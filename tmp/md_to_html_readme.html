<h2 id="what-is-the-game-about-">WHAT IS THE GAME ABOUT ?</h2>
<p>Plant is a 2 players strategy game, where the goal is to take as much space as possible on the terrain with a plant by making it growing.<br />
Turn by turn, each player make his plant grow a bit. While the game progress, it become harder and harder to move and you have to deal with<br />
the opponent to block him from progressing. But be sure to not be blocked too ! Once the game is finished, the player that took the most<br />
cases on the terrain win. You can find complete rules at Plant Rules.html.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-supported-devices-">WHAT ARE THE SUPPORTED DEVICES ?</h2>
<p>We only support computer devices. Supported OS are Windows 32-bit and 64-bit. We're actually not in the capacity to support Mac and Linux but <br />
for the moment we don't close the door to those devices :).</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-play-">HOW DO I PLAY ?</h2>
<p>All you have to do is run the file called "index.html" ! The game will load in a browser, and we recommend using Chrome or, in last case<br />
Firefox to get the best experience and avoid problems.</p>
<p><strong><strong>START THE GAME :</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on "Start new game".</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>WHAT TO DO IN A TURN :</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on a stem on the grid to set the start of your new stem (points on your plant indicate those where you can move from).</li>
<li>Move using ZQSD.</li>
<li>If you don't like your path you can restart it by reclicking on your start, or by choosing a new one, and by redrawing it like below.</li>
<li>When you're done, use the Space Bar to validate. It's now next player's turn, and he plays the same way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>END OF THE GAME :</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The game ends when the 2nd player do his last turn, or when one of the players is stuck at his turn.</li>
</ul>
<p>PS : You can find a lot more useful information ingame, by accessing the rules from the main menu.</p>
