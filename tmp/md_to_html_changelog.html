<li>Objective and rules of the game (may change in the future and become obsolete ==&gt; check Plant Rules.html):<ul>
<li>Players : 2</li>
<li>Terrain grid size : 25x25</li>
<li>Dice : 3,4,5,6,7,8 (each has the same probability to be taken)</li>
<li>Start : top center &amp; bottom center</li>
<li>Rules of moving :<ul>
<li>Players plays after each other.</li>
<li>20 turns. (1 turn = p1+p2 play)</li>
<li>Once dice dropped, the player choose the start of his stem, then make it grow as much as the number allow.</li>
<li>Moving :<br />
<code>___________________________________________________________________</code><br />
<code>| Moving Direction | .Top Player (Blue) . | Bottom Player (Green) |</code><br />
<code>|==================|======================|=======================|</code><br />
<code>| . . .TOP . . . . | . . .impossible. . . | . . . no limit. . . . |</code><br />
<code>| . . .BOTTOM. . . | . . . no limit . . . | . . .impossible . . . |</code><br />
<code>| . . .LEFT. . . . | cannot be twice done | cannot be twice done. |</code><br />
<code>| . . .RIGHT . . . | cannot be twice done | cannot be twice done. |</code><br />
<code>|==================|======================|=======================|</code></li>
<li>A stem cannot do more than 8 cases.</li>
<li>When a stem is 8 cases long, a flower appear on the 8th case of the stem, keeping safe for the player cases arround<br />
(Those cases are reserved but not counted into the score, those still has to be taken by the plant !).<br />
This is done using this pattern :<br />
<code>OO#OO</code><br />
<code>O###O</code><br />
<code>##F##</code><br />
<code>O###O</code><br />
<code>OO#OO</code><br />
Where F is the flower, # is reserved, O a classic case.</li>
<li>It is possible to start a new stem from another stem (not a flower !) (to the start of the turn only).</li>
<li>A case cannot contain the 2 players. If one player take that case, the other cannot access this one anymore.</li>
<li>A stem cannot be continued if no others moves are available. If while moving the player used all it's moves,<br />
the other moves left cannot be used.</li>
<li>If all the turns are ended, or if one of the players is completely stuck at his turn, the game is ended.</li>
<li>The player who taken the most cases win.</li></ul></li>
<li>The player choose it's moving before validating.</li></ul></li>
<li>Features :<ul>
<li>Canvas initialization, drawing grid, and with arrows can draw lines of players (directional arrows and Enter on keyboard).</li>
<li>Score depending of player's cases taken.</li>
<li>Preview canvas on the game canvas to draw gray lines, they show the path the player will select.</li>
<li>Players database display auto updated for selected variables.<strong>(1)</strong></li>
<li>Event that listen the keyboard.</li>
<li>A function to know if a number is odd (isOdd();).</li>
<li>2 functions x() and y() to convert a coordinate to top/left in pixels.</li>
<li>Movements :<ul>
<li>Does not contain turn, dice, length limitation, point of start of the stem, players' collision, border collision,<br />
game end, option to restart.</li>
<li>Contain score count, moving limitations reguarding the direction, order to play (the green always start), player path<br />
preview.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> In UpdateTabData(), a line is needed to update a variable to an attributed HTML element, the variable must be into player1 and player2<br />
object, otherwise it needs additional data transfer using sessionStorage().</p>
<h2 id="a01b2--october-20th-2018">a0.1b2 | October, 20th 2018</h2>
<ul>
<li>Movement :<ul>
<li>Added turn, dice, length limitation, players' collision, border collision, game end.</li>
<li>Still not contain point of start of the stem (in work, with the function SetLineStart(player,X,Y)).</li></ul></li>
<li>Added a tilemap database saving for each case the item type (line, flower), the player owner of the case, and if it's connected to<br />
top/bottom/left/right.</li>
<li>Added the bottom interface :<ul>
<li>Button to start the game</li>
<li>Dice and random value</li>
<li>Turn count</li>
<li>End of the game with winner, looser and draw for turn count end only. <strong>(1)</strong></li>
<li>Message explaining why the player can't perform a move when it's the case.</li>
<li>Button to restart. No need for a refresh anymore, with the result of a much more optimized restart !</li></ul></li>
<li>Now the player that must play has an overlay to his tab.</li>
<li>BUG FIX : Cleaned initialization, deleted double var declaration. <strong>(2)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> The game won't detect if both players are stuck, and this will result in a need to skip all turns until the last one.<br />
<strong>(2)</strong> No variable from another file can be accessible directly "as is" in p5.js function such as setup() and draw(). We recommend using<br />
external functions call if such variables need an interaction with p5.js functions. </p>
<h2 id="a01b3--december-21st-2018">a0.1b3 | December, 21st 2018</h2>
<ul>
<li>Movement :<ul>
<li>Added point of start of the stem. The player can also restart it's preview to do a new preview.</li>
<li>Added limitation for stem length</li>
<li>Added the flower and their aura blocking cases for the opponent.</li></ul></li>
<li>The game now ends if one of the players is bloqued at the end of a player turn.</li>
<li>Added a very early and simple way to visualize where the player can start from depending of available movements from these cases.</li>
<li>BUG FIX : On the start of the stem connected to the left or the right, you could again draw preview in the same direction, whereas it is<br />
forbidden in the rules.</li>
<li>BUG FIX : Small fixes in the calcul of the stem length.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a02b1--december-26th-2018">a0.2b1 | December, 26th 2018</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some cleaning in variables and functions <strong>(1)</strong> :<ul>
<li>Fixed the wrong traduction of "move(s)" and replaced it by "movement(s)".</li>
<li>All variables related to html display have been grouped in the object "display".</li>
<li>All variables related to preview line style have been grouped in the object "preview_line".</li>
<li>All variables containing an html button element have been grouped in the object "button".</li>
<li>Cleaned the html elements IDs and classes to fit these changes.</li>
<li>Moved mathematical methods not specific to the game into the file "mathematical_methods.js". (ex: IsOdd(); and GetRandom();)</li>
<li>Better support of errors : for functions handling parameters, these parameters are verified to fit the intended form in the<br />
function <strong>(2)</strong>.</li>
<li>Some functions didn't have comments explaining what they do.</li>
<li>max stem length and dice range are now easily customizable rules by only changing the value of their respective variables<br />
in the object "rules".</li></ul></li>
<li>Added victories counting</li>
<li>Added an how to play tutorial in README.txt</li>
<li>Improved turn display (now display actual turn from the max of turns : (actual turn)/(max_turn)</li>
<li>BUG FIX : Sometime at the very start of the runtime it were possible that an error where trown (player1_collected==null) because the game<br />
try to display data whereas there is nothing to display yet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> WARNING : Meaning from a0.1 to a0.2 lot of variables and functions have changed of name to include these changes!<br />
<strong>(2)</strong> For every new function handling parameters is it highly recommended to support this, using the following format (can fit in a single<br />
line of code) :</p>
<pre><code class="js language-js">if (("parameters to verify are false") /*(type, allowed values, defined or not, optional or not, etc))*/ {
    console.error("[&lt;domain&gt;]{&lt;function&gt;} Invalid argument for parameter '&lt;parameter&gt;' : expected &lt;what was expected&gt;, got"+"&lt;parameter&gt;");
    return;
}
//if the error should drop a structure (array, object, table, etc...), instead of using the format "console.error(""+var)",
//it is recommended to use the more appropriated format "console.error("");console.log(var);"</code></pre>
<h2 id="a02b2--december-28th-2018">a0.2b2 | December, 28th 2018</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved radically the display of cases where a player can start from (added in a0.1b3). This is now correctly implemented,<br />
use the colors of the player, and now only shows the available movements for the player who is playing, but during the whole turn<br />
(not cleared anymore once dice is dropped ! Also fixed the bug when you validate without any movement making black dots very big.<br />
Finally now it uses it's own canvas instead of using the preview graph which was the reason of the erasement on dice drop.).</li>
<li>balancing :<ul>
<li>Reduced grid size from 25x25 to 21x21.</li>
<li>Changed dice range from 3-8 to 3-6 (8 movements dropped by dice were actually impossible to fully do before this version,<br />
this change aim to fix that).</li>
<li>Added bonus (to remove the dependance of luck in scores) :<ul>
<li>Added a bonus of 2 points when creating a flower</li>
<li>Added a bonus of 1 point for each stem case touching the opposite side of the grid.</li>
<li>Added a bonus of 1 point for each aura case touching the opponent's plant. This point is stolen from the opponent!</li>
<li>When the player turn is ended the bonus optained is displayed in the bottom tab<br />
(internally : moved "SendMessage.ClearMessage();" from "ChangeTurn();" function to "GetRandomMovement();" function, so<br />
the bonus can be displayed, and it's erased when the next player drop the dice)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Updated Plant Rules.html to apply balancing.</li>
<li>The bottom tab height has been increased (120px -&gt; 200px) to handle more information.</li>
<li>BUG FIX : The initial stem from players were not counted in score.</li>
<li>BUG FIX : The data about cases containing initial starts weren't accurate : movements from the opponent of the player who own that<br />
start case were stored as possible whereas it's fully false.</li>
<li>BUG FIX : Sometime the game ended when the player 2 were bloqued but when it was not it's turn and the other player could still play.</li>
<li>BUG FIX : Link of the licence were not appearing in the header of Plant Rules.html although this were written in the code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a02b3--december-29th-2018">a0.2b3 | December, 29th 2018</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added advices in "Plant Rules.html".</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a03b1--february-23th-2019">a0.3b1 | February, 23th 2019</h2>
<ul>
<li>Integration of Electron.js for creating executables <strong>(1)</strong></li>
<li>Added loading screen <strong>(2)</strong></li>
<li>Added main menu <strong>(2)</strong><ul>
<li>play : play the game.</li>
<li>tutorial and rules : access to those, tutorial not added yet.</li>
<li>options : option menu, with sound and music volume, plus high or low quality option. Missing other options, and not functional.</li>
<li>credits : full credits, with link to README.txt, LICENSE.txt, NOTICE.txt.</li>
<li>quit : quit button, same as quit to the top tab but with warning. Top tab is meant to disappear.</li></ul></li>
<li>Of course you can go back to menu, once a game is launched, with the new go back to menu button on game end.</li>
<li>New key bindings : replaced arrows by ZQSD and Enter by spacebar.</li>
<li>Updated Plant Rules.html to explain better how to play.</li>
<li>Updated README.txt to make some fixs (grammar, more readable, fixed some wrong infos…)</li>
<li>Removed the get button to obtain the movements. It's now directly given on turn change.</li>
<li>Removed in app notice display in Plant Rules.html.</li>
<li>changed some ID names :<ul>
<li>(div) : "canvas_handler" --&gt; "game_layers_handler"</li>
<li>var : "canvas" --&gt; "main_layer_canvas" <strong>(3)</strong></li></ul></li>
<li>Updated copyright to 2019.</li>
<li>Prepared the graphism processing for the coming beta cycle :<ul>
<li>Reorganized p5 main functions in canvas.js (setup, preload, draw), they stay in that file but are clearly separated from<br />
the game process.</li>
<li>Added the div that will handle most of the graphical process.</li>
<li>Prepared canvas corresponding to the graphical structure of the background and the main graphical effects.</li>
<li>Prepared the file (background.js) handling the process, with functions called and ready, but empty.</li>
<li>All these changes are not visible at all by the user, and do not have a big impact on performance, so the code is kept functional.</li>
<li>Some graphism work as started, but this time it is hidden, puting the code in comment. It includes :<ul>
<li>shadow_effect : done trough div+css with this ID, ellipse gradient from alpha 0 at center to a semi-transparent color<br />
in corners,<br />
one black and one yellow, creating depth.</li>
<li>floating_particles : a canvas layer displaying floating yellow particles, like fireflies for ambience.</li>
<li>leaves button on main menu : button redesigned as leaves using pure css, without image.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>BUG FIX : Flower aura bonus was sometime displaying a wrong value, but graphically only, not affecting the gameplay.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> When opening the project in git, the command to run the game is "npm start". Also the compiler is not final, we actually integrated<br />
a compiler. Finally we will consider security for the public beta, and isn't in work for alpha. So we won't make any external link<br />
accessible directly from the app.<br />
to get an executable directly, but we plan on maybe setup an installer which will be more user friendly.<br />
<strong>(2)</strong> The game has been splitted into scenes, annd the main game is now one of those scenes.<br />
<strong>(3)</strong> There is no more reason having a main process canvas, as now there's different layers for the main game display, and also other canvas<br />
for graphism in the future. Although it is still the most important one, so it has been renamed in consequence. But we've applied the<br />
following change to get less ambiguity in the code :</p>
<ul>
<li>main_layer_canvas is now a CreateGraphics() process and no more a CreateCanvas() process.</li>
<li>all actions from p5 related to main_layer_canvas has, as it's the case for all other canvas, a prefix like the following :<br />
"main_layer_canvas.(action)"<br />
ex : main_layer_canvas.line(args…);</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="beta">BETA</h1>
<h2 id="010b1--march-28th-2019">0.1.0(b1) | March, 28th 2019</h2>
<ul>
<li>Big graphical revamp started <strong>(1)</strong> :<ul>
<li>Everything is themed on nature.</li>
<li>Disabled graphical features from the alpha a0.3b1 are enabled back.<ul>
<li>The floating_particle system has slightly changed : improved performances<br />
(using a .svg image instead of an intensive dynamic draw), reviewed style a bit, and finally they've dynamic position,<br />
by this understand a random proportional speed and size to make a feel of 3D/depth.</li></ul></li>
<li>A new fancy dynamic background, only missing falling leaves.</li>
<li>Removed the header.</li>
<li>A new font is used for every text in the game.</li>
<li>A new "assets" folder has been created where you can find all required resources relative to graphism and sound.</li>
<li>That's the only changes for now, and still a lot of progress is needed, the UI is not finished yet too.</li></ul></li>
<li>Added FPS display in top left corner.</li>
<li>The version now appear in the credits menu.</li>
<li>Canvas elements are no more called using "div.children[i]" but using "p5_canvas.elt", avoiding possible bugs if the canvas<br />
order change in the future.</li>
<li>Removed jQuery which was completely useless.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> This introduced performances problems, so be sure to run the app without too much process behind from other apps!</p>
