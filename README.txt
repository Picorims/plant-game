#  WHAT IS THE GAME ABOUT ?  #
##############################

Plant is a 2 players strategy game, where the goal is to take as much space as possible on the terrain with a plant by making it growing.
Turn by turn, each player make his plant grow a bit. While the game progress, it become harder and harder to move and you have to deal with
the opponent to block him from progressing. But be sure to not be blocked too ! Once the game is finished, the player that took the most
cases on the terrain win. You can find complete rules at Plant Rules.html.


######################################
#  WHAT ARE THE SUPPORTED DEVICES ?  #
######################################

We only support computer devices. Supported OS are Windows 32-bit and 64-bit. We're actually not in the capacity to support Mac and Linux but 
for the moment we don't close the door to those devices :).


#####################
#  HOW DO I PLAY ?  #
#####################

All you have to do is run the file called "index.html" ! The game will load in a browser, and we recommend using Chrome or, in last case
Firefox to get the best experience and avoid problems.

START THE GAME :
- Click on "Start new game".

WHAT TO DO IN A TURN :
- Click on a stem on the grid to set the start of your new stem (points on your plant indicate those where you can move from).
- Move using ZQSD.
- If you don't like your path you can restart it by reclicking on your start, or by choosing a new one, and by redrawing it like below.
- When you're done, use the Space Bar to validate. It's now next player's turn, and he plays the same way.

END OF THE GAME :
- The game ends when the 2nd player do his last turn, or when one of the players is stuck at his turn.

PS : You can find a lot more useful information ingame, by accessing the rules from the main menu.


#############################
#  HOW CAN I CONTACT YOU ?  #
#############################

- Picorims : picorims.contact@gmail.com with the object :
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   "[Plant](help or support|pro|suggestion|bug|<other demand>) <title>"   |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Choose an option within the "()", and replace <title> by what is your mail about. Keep the "[Plant]" and the "()".


- Cirno : Cirno actually didn't wanted to share his private concact and actually doesn't have any public way of being contacted. So you can
use the mail adress below, by using the object :
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   "[Plant](help or support|pro|suggestion|bug|<other demand>){To Cirno} <title>"   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Choose an option within the "()", and replace <title> by what you want. Keep the "[Plant]", the "()" and "{To Cirno}" (mostly that, if you
don't want me to think it's mine (Picorims) :p).
It will then be transmitted to him !

==> This is to help us manage and easily find your mail, so please consider using that format !


####################################
#  WHERE CAN I KNOW THE CHANGES ?  #
####################################

You can see CHANGELOG.txt to know everything that changed. Then go to the category refering to the build you actually have, indicated to
the top of this file. You should check all changelogs for the same versions (every build from a single version), as the last build
do not always contain the full changelog of the concerned version!


###################################################################
#  I WOULD LIKE TO USE YOUR PROGRAM OR PART OF IT IN MY PROJECT.  #
